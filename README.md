# Interacties

This is my first official individual project!

My goal for this is to create a browser based OBS overlay for a livestream.

Features may include:

- [x] Beat Saber name and ScoreSaber rank
- [x] Heart rate scraped from Pulsoid
- [x] Timed animations so everything isn't displayed all the time
- [x] Modular component use based on parameters set on page call
- [x] Settings in config file
- [ ] User interface to toggle/use interactions and change settings
- [X] Chat integration
- [ ] Other interactions done via chat

Installation Requirements:

- Node.JS (latest)

Subject to change.
