# Interacties

This is my first official individual project!

My goal for this is to create a browser based OBS overlay for a livestream.

Features may include:

- [x] Beat Saber name and ScoreSaber rank
- [ ] Heart rate pulled from Pulsoid (through an iframe, perchance?)
- [ ] Timed animations so everything isn't displayed all the time
- [ ] Chat integration
- [ ] Other interactions done via chat
